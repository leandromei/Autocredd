Force Deploy v5 - Fixed httpx import and Dockerfile configuration
Deployment timestamp: 2025-01-06 14:54:00

Changes made:
1. Fixed Dockerfile.light to run app_real.py instead of simple_app.py
2. Updated Procfile to use app_real:app
3. Added pip upgrade in Dockerfile for better dependency resolution
4. Created debug_imports.py to test all imports
5. Verified requirements.txt has httpx==0.25.2

This should resolve the ModuleNotFoundError for httpx.
